  A thriving frontier region in the early 20th century Pacific Northwest where many built their fortunes amidst the rugged beauty of Puget Sound.
  Unprecedented growth transformed it from a collection of small logging camps into a bustling industrial center. Massive lumber mills processed the ancient forests, salmon canneries lined the bay, and coal mines fueled the region's expansion.
