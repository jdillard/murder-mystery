historical_inspiration: "Ella Higginson was one of the Pacific Northwest's most celebrated writers, and later became Washington State's first Poet Laureate. Her poems and stories, many published in national magazines, brought Bellingham literary recognition in an age dominated by industry. Known for her wit and strong voice, Higginson gave the Northwest cultural prestige, proving that the region's wealth wasn't only measured in timber or copper, but also in words."
