  [Lottie Roth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottie_Roth_Block) was part of the Roth family, early settlers and businesspeople who were deeply tied to Whatcom County's land and timber industries.
  Though less publicly known than some of her male contemporaries, she represented the families who gained and lost fortunes as timber speculation reshaped the local economy.
  As an heiress and landholder, she stood at the intersection of old pioneer claims and the new industrial order.

introduction: "I am the Landowner of a pioneer family whose lands stretch deep into Whatcom's timber country. My concern is that the industrial moguls take too much, too fast — leaving little for the families who've lived here for generations."
victim_relationship: "The Magnate is the industrial titan threatening to destroy your family's agricultural legacy. Their copper mining and real estate speculation has already claimed neighboring farms, and you know your family's ancestral land is next on their acquisition list.

Your family's pioneer heritage means nothing to them compared to mineral rights and development potential."
