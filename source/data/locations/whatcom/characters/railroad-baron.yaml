historical_inspiration: |
  [Nelson Bennett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Bennett) was a Canadian-born railroad builder and businessman who played a central role in developing Fairhaven in the late 1800s.
  He was instrumental in bringing the Great Northern Railway to town, fueling hopes that Fairhaven would become the region's great port.
  Though those dreams faded, Bennett remained a symbol of ambition and hard-nosed competition — especially against rivals like the Larrabees.
introduction: "I am the Railroad Baron — I've laid more track than anyone west of the Mississippi, and I brought the Great Northern Railroad here to Fairhaven. Some say I have rivals at this table, but business is never for the faint of heart."
gossip: "The Railroad Baron has been spotted meeting with out-of-town investors — word is they're planning to bypass Fairhaven entirely and build a competing rail line."

  guilty: "Yes, I poisoned the Magnate! They cheated me out of millions and threatened to destroy everything I built. When someone steals your life's work and tries to ruin you completely, you fight back with everything you have."
