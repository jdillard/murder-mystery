  [Nelson Bennett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Bennett) was a Canadian-born railroad builder and businessman who played a central role in developing Fairhaven in the late 1800s.
  He was instrumental in bringing the Great Northern Railway to town, fueling hopes that Fairhaven would become the region's great port.
  Though those dreams faded, Bennett remained a symbol of ambition and hard-nosed competition — especially against rivals like the Larrabees.
