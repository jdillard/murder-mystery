  [Nelson Bennett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Bennett) was a Canadian-born railroad builder and businessman who played a central role in developing Fairhaven in the late 1800s.
  He was instrumental in bringing the Great Northern Railway to town, fueling hopes that Fairhaven would become the region's great port.
  Though those dreams faded, Bennett remained a symbol of ambition and hard-nosed competition — especially against rivals like the Larrabees.

introduction: "I am the Railroad Baron — I've laid more track than anyone west of the Mississippi, and I brought the Great Northern Railroad here to Fairhaven. Some say I have rivals at this table, but business is never for the faint of heart."
victim_relationship: "The Magnate is your former business partner turned bitter rival. You both brought the Great Northern Railway to Fairhaven and initially shared dreams of making it the Pacific Northwest's greatest port.

They've since cut you out of major deals and publicly dismissed your contributions to Fairhaven's development, fueling a personal vendetta that's consumed you for years."
