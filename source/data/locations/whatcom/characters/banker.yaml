  [James J. Donovan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Donovan) was a lawyer, politician, and developer who rose to prominence during the push to unify Whatcom County's four competing towns — Fairhaven, Whatcom, Sehome, and Bellingham — into a single city.
  As mayor of Fairhaven and later a Washington State senator, he was a key player in the political maneuvering of the time.
  His blend of law, politics, and real estate made him one of the county's most influential power brokers.
