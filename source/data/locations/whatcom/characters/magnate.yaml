  [Charles Xavier Larrabee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._X._Larrabee) was a copper magnate and philanthropist who moved to Fairhaven in 1890.
  With his brother Samuel, he invested heavily in mines, real estate, and civic projects, leaving a lasting mark on Bellingham.
  He and his wife Frances donated land that became Larrabee State Park — Washington's first state park.
  Known as both generous and ambitious, Larrabee embodied the boomtown energy of early 20th-century Whatcom County."
