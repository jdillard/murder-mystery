historical_inspiration: "Frances Payne Larrabee, wife of C.X., was one of the city's most respected social leaders. Beyond her role as hostess, she advocated for education, the arts, and public parks. After her husband's death, she carried forward his legacy, ensuring the donation of 20 acres of land that became the core of Larrabee State Park. She represents the quieter but deeply influential civic contributions of women in the region's history."
