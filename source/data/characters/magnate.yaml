historical_inspiration: "Charles Xavier Larrabee was a copper magnate and philanthropist who moved to Fairhaven in 1890. With his brother Samuel, he invested heavily in mines, real estate, and civic projects, leaving a lasting mark on Bellingham. He and his wife Frances donated land that became Larrabee State Park — Washington's first state park. Known as both generous and ambitious, Larrabee embodied the boomtown energy of early 20th-century Whatcom County."
