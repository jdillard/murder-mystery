<h2>Clue Distribution Information</h2>

<p>These clues are distributed to guests during different acts of the murder mystery game. Each character receives specific clues that help piece together the mystery while maintaining suspicion on multiple suspects.</p>

<p><strong>Timing:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clue 1 (Act II):</strong> Hand out after Magnate's announcement, during first course.</li>
  <li><strong>Clue 2 (Act III):</strong> Hand out right after the murder discovery.</li>
  <li><strong>Clue 3 (Act IV):</strong> Hand out during the investigation/debate round.</li>
</ul>

<p>All clues are <strong>subtle and partially incriminating</strong>, so the guests can piece things together without it being obvious from the start. Other suspects remain suspicious due to red herrings (notes, proximity, overheard arguments).</p>
