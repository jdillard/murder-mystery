## ACT I: First Course and Announcement

- **Duration**: 20min

During appetizers/soup C.X. Larrabee makes a dramatic announcement about his **new venture** (railroad expansion, cannery buyouts, copper scheme — you pick).

> "My dear friends, you are all gathered at my home tonight not merely for the pleasure of your company — though that is considerable — but because each of you has played a role in shaping Whatcom County's destiny. Such as James Donovan advocating for cooperation between our communities and helping rally the support that made unity possible, and Nelson Bennett who saw the potential to create great communities around our bay.
>
> We all remember the struggles of recent years — the boom times having cooled, the competition between Whatcom, Sehome, Bellingham, and Fairhaven was holding our entire region back. We were weakening ourselves through division.
>
> But look what we accomplished through unity! The consolidation of our communities into the great city of Bellingham has proven the wisdom of setting aside petty rivalries. By unifying our resources and strengthening our collective appeal to industry, we have created something far greater than the sum of its parts.
>
> Now, I also have a proposal to make, I wish to share with you the most ambitious undertaking of my career: a grand consolidation of our region's timber, mining, and railroad interests under a single enterprise — **The Bellingham Bay Development Corporation**. Just as our communities succeeded through unity, so too must our commercial enterprises unite under a single, coordinated purpose.
>
> This venture will require the acquisition of several key properties and partnerships. Nelson, your railroad expertise will be invaluable, though I'm afraid our previous arrangements will need... restructuring. James, your banking connections are essential, and I trust we can resolve certain outstanding obligations through this new partnership. Miss Roth, your family's timber holdings are precisely what we need to complete our vision — I'm confident we can reach terms that serve everyone's interests.
>
> Some of you may find these changes... challenging. But progress demands sacrifice from all of us. Those who embrace this new direction will prosper beyond their wildest dreams. Those who resist..."
>
> *[Larrabee raises his glass with a knowing smile]*
>
> "Well, let us simply say that Whatcom County has no room for those who cannot see the future clearly. To the Bellingham Bay Development Corporation — and to those wise enough to join me!"

At this point, you slip short secret notes/cards (see clue packs) to each character — little rumors or discoveries they can use later

(example: Donovan gets a card saying *“You overheard Larrabee telling Bennett he will never see his money back.”*).

Allow guests to mingle and gossip, dropping hints about motives. Encourage subtle in-character accusations or jealous remarks. This news threatens at least 2–3 characters directly. Arguments or icy exchanges may follow. Encourage guests to start gossiping and hinting at grudges (“I hear Mr. Donovan has lent quite a sum to our host…”).

## Act II: The Murder

- **Duration**: 15min

### Setting the Scene

As guests are finishing their appetizers and mingling, the murder occurs:

**Staging the Murder:**
- Dim the lights suddenly
- Play a crash/breaking glass sound effect
- After 10-15 seconds, restore lighting with urgent atmosphere

### The Discovery

The announcement should be made with dramatic tension by the ghost of C.X. Larrabee:

> *[C.X. Larrabee's ghost, appearing ethereal and mournful]*
>
> "My dear friends... I'm afraid I bring the most dreadful news. I have been... murdered. Struck down in my own study with a decorative letter opener from my desk."
>
> *[Pause for shocked reactions]*
>
> "My earthly form lies cold in my private study, a brandy glass overturned, spilling across my business papers. There are signs of a brief struggle - my killer did not expect such resistance. The door was locked from inside - the key found in my vest pocket."
>
> "The constable cannot reach us tonight due to the storm, and the roads are treacherous. Until morning, I'm afraid you are all... confined to this house with my murderer. My study has been secured, but I must ask from beyond - did any of you see who visited me after I made my announcement this evening?"
>
> "I shall remain among you as a spirit observer, watching as justice unfolds. Find my killer, dear friends... find them before dawn breaks."

### Immediate Reactions & Staging Notes

**For the Host:**

- **Guide initial reactions** - Encourage gasps, questions, nervous laughter
- **Control the revelation** - Don't let guests immediately jump into accusations

**Character Reaction Guidelines:**
- **Innocent characters** should show genuine shock and concern
- **Guilty party** should react with appropriate surprise but not overact
- **Characters with motives** might display nervous guilt even if innocent
- **Close relationships** should show more emotional responses


### Transitioning to Investigation

After initial shock subsides:

> [*Donavan speaks*] "While we await the authorities, perhaps we should gather what we know. For all our safety, we must determine if the perpetrator is among us."

**Hand out Clue Pack #1** to each character (see Clue Packs section).

Serve the first course while allowing hushed conversations and nervous speculation. Encourage guests to:

- Share their alibis quietly
- Whisper suspicions
- Form temporary alliances
- Begin revealing their hidden motives through worried confessions

**Host's Role:** Subtly guide conversations if energy drops, but don't solve the mystery for them. Ask leading questions: "Did anyone else notice how quickly Mr. Bennett excused himself after dinner?" or "Miss Roth, you seemed quite upset by the business announcement..."

## Act III: Investigation and Debate

- **Duration**: 50min

### Scene setting

The investigation should feel organic while maintaining structure. Guide guests through three distinct phases:

### Round 1 – Alibis and Initial Theories (15min)

> "[Frances Larrabee] Given our situation, I believe we must conduct our own investigation. Perhaps if we each share our whereabouts during the time in question, we can begin to understand what happened to my dear husband. Each character should explain their movements after Larrabee's announcement."

**Process:**
- Host should note contradictions without immediately pointing them out
- Encourage nervous explanations and defensive reactions

**Key Alibis to Track:**

- **Bennett (guilty):** "I stepped out for fresh air on the terrace - needed to think about his proposal"
- **Donovan:** "I was in the library, reviewing some papers I brought"
- **Frances Larrabee:** "I was instructing the cook about the next course"
- Others should have plausible but not ironclad alibis

**Host's Role:** Ask follow-up questions: "Miss Roth, did you see anyone else when you were in the garden?" "Mr. Bennett, how long were you outside? Anyone see you return?"

### Round 2 – Physical Evidence and New Clues (20min)

**Hand out Clue Pack #2** with more specific evidence.

> "Upon closer inspection of the study, we've found several items of interest. The constable's deputy arrived briefly but had to leave due to a bridge washout. He did share these observations..."

**Evidence to Reveal:**
- Muddy footprints leading from the terrace door to the study
- A torn piece of fabric caught on the study window latch
- Larrabee's appointment book showing "Bennett - private meeting - 8:30"
- A partially burned letter in the fireplace (related to railroad debts)
- Signs that someone searched through desk papers before the murder

**Character Reactions:**
- Let guilty parties show subtle nervousness
- Innocent characters should actively theorize
- Allow red herrings to develop naturally

### Round 3 – Open Accusations and Defense (15min)

> "The evidence seems to point in various directions. Perhaps it's time we speak more directly about what we each know - and what we suspect."

**Encourage:**
- Direct accusations based on evidence
- Defensive responses that reveal character motives
- Alliance forming and backstabbing
- Heated exchanges that stay in character

**Host's Management:**
- Keep discussions civil but intense
- Redirect if conversations stagnate
- Ask probing questions: "Mr. Bennett, that's quite a strong reaction. Why does this accusation trouble you so?"
- Plant seeds of doubt: "Interesting that three different people claim to have been alone..."

**Red Herring Management:**
- Multiple characters should appear guilty at different points
- Evidence should implicate 2-3 suspects strongly
- Save the most damning evidence against Bennett for the final reveal

## Act IV: The Reveal

- **Duration**: 20min

### Building to the Confession

**Final Evidence Presentation:**

> "I'm afraid there's one final piece of evidence that has come to light. When examining Mr. Larrabee's study more closely, we found this telegram hidden beneath other papers on his desk..."

**The Damning Evidence:**
A telegram reading: *"RAILROAD BONDS WORTHLESS STOP INVESTORS DEMANDING IMMEDIATE REPAYMENT STOP BENNETT LIABLE FOR FULL AMOUNT STOP FEDERAL INVESTIGATION PENDING"*

### Bennett's Confession

> *[Bennett, defeated]* "Yes... yes, it's true. I killed C.X. Larrabee, but you must understand - he was going to destroy me! Those railroad bonds he convinced me to purchase were worthless paper. He knew it, and yet he demanded I invest everything I had saved for my family's future. When he announced tonight that our 'previous arrangements would need restructuring,' he was essentially telling me I would never see a penny of my money again. Worse, he was planning to use my ruin as a stepping stone for his new venture."
>
> "I didn't plan to kill him. I went to his study to demand the truth about those bonds. When I confronted him with what I'd learned, he laughed. He said that business was about knowing when to cut losses - and that I was simply a loss he was cutting. He actually offered to 'keep me on' as a junior partner in his new venture, knowing I'd be working essentially for free to pay off debts for his worthless investments. When I refused and threatened to expose him... he said no one would believe a bankrupt railroad man over C.X. Larrabee. That's when I... I grabbed the letter opener - it happened so quickly."

### Character Epilogues

> "And so ends this tragic evening. While we await the proper authorities, let us reflect on how greed and deception can poison even the most civilized of gatherings."
>
> - **Nelson Bennett:** Will face trial for murder, but the questionable business practices may be taken into account
> - **James Donovan:** Recovers his loans through Larrabee's estate, continues banking
> - **Frances Larrabee:** Inherits the estate, moves to Seattle for a fresh start
> - **Lottie Roth:** Keeps her family's timber holdings, eventually becomes a successful businesswoman
> - **Other characters:** Brief, satisfying conclusions based on their revealed motives
>
> "To truth revealed, and to the hope that justice, however delayed, eventually finds us all."

*End scene with guests breaking character for final discussion and appreciation of the game.*
