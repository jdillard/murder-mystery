These character packs contain everything each guest needs to play their role in the murder mystery.
Each pack includes the character card with personality traits and motives, their introduction speech, hidden secrets that drive the story forward, and all the clues they will receive throughout the game.

Print one pack per guest and distribute at the beginning of the game.

## Clue Distribution Information

These clues are distributed to guests during different acts of the murder mystery game. Each character receives specific clues that help piece together the mystery while maintaining suspicion on multiple suspects.

**Timing:**

- **Clue 1 (Act II):** Hand out after Magnate's announcement, during first course.
- **Clue 2 (Act III):** Hand out right after the murder discovery.
- **Clue 3 (Act IV):** Hand out during the investigation/debate round.

All clues are **subtle and partially incriminating**, so the guests can piece things together without it being obvious from the start. Other suspects remain suspicious due to red herrings (notes, proximity, overheard arguments).

**Key Information:**

- **Victim**: Magnate
- **Murderer**: Railroad Baron
