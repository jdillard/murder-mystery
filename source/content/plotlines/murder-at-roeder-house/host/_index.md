**[Character Packs](character-packs/)** - Print one pack per guest and distribute at the beginning of the game.

## Arrival and Introductions

### Arrival

- **Duration**: 15min

As guests arrive:

- Serve drinks and small appetizers
- Guests arrive at the Roeder home for a formal dinner.
  - Encourage light conversation in character — mingle, establish relationships, and subtle tension.
  - Non-prying small talk until all guests arrive
- Answer any gameplay questions

### Introductions

- **Duration**: 15min

Once all guests have arrived:

- Grab attention
- Give role cards with their hidden motive(s)
  -  Guests don't reveal their secret motives yet.
- Each guest gives a short introduction of themselves

## ACT I: First Course and Announcement

- **Duration**: 20min
- **Host Note:** Before the game begins, randomly select which character will make this announcement. Inform that player privately that they should deliver this speech during the first course.

During appetizers/soup **[RANDOMLY SELECTED CHARACTER]** makes an announcement on behalf of the Roeder family.

> "My dear friends, I've been asked by the Roeder family to speak on their behalf this evening, as they're dealing with some family matters at the moment.
>
> You are all gathered here tonight to celebrate Bellingham's remarkable recent consolidation and the successes that have followed. We all remember the struggles of recent years — the boom times having cooled, the competition between Whatcom, Sehome, Bellingham, and Fairhaven was holding our entire region back. We were weakening ourselves through division.
>
> But look what we accomplished through unity! The consolidation of our communities into the great city of Bellingham has proven the wisdom of setting aside petty rivalries. By unifying our resources and strengthening our collective appeal to industry, we have created something far greater than the sum of its parts.
>
> Each of you has played a vital role in this transformation. The Banker advocating for cooperation between our communities, Railroad Baron who saw the potential to create great communities around our bay, Farmer's Daughter whose family's timber interests have flourished in this unified market. The Roeder family wanted to personally honor these partnerships and celebrate our shared prosperity.
>
> The opportunities ahead of us are tremendous. With our unified city, we can attract greater investment, expand our industries, and secure Bellingham's position as the premier destination on Puget Sound. Some of you may find upcoming changes in our business arrangements... challenging, but progress demands adaptation from all of us. Those who embrace this new direction will prosper beyond their wildest dreams.
>
> *[Raises glass with a confident smile]*
>
> To Bellingham's bright future, and to those wise enough to seize the opportunities before us!"

At this point, you slip short secret notes/cards (see clue packs) to each character — little rumors or discoveries they can use later

(example: Donovan gets a card saying *"You overheard Heinrich telling Bennett he will never see his money back."*).

Allow guests to mingle and gossip, dropping hints about motives. Encourage subtle in-character accusations or jealous remarks. This news threatens at least 2–3 characters directly. Arguments or icy exchanges may follow. Encourage guests to start gossiping and hinting at grudges (“I hear The Banker has lent quite a sum to our host…”).

## Act II: The Murder

- **Duration**: 15min

### Setting the Scene

As guests are finishing their appetizers and mingling, the murder occurs:

**Staging the Murder:**
- Dim the lights suddenly
- Play a crash/breaking glass sound effect
- After 10-15 seconds, restore lighting with urgent atmosphere

### The Discovery

The announcement should be made with dramatic tension by the ghost of Heinrich Roeder (the family patriarch):

> *[Heinrich Roeder's ghost, appearing ethereal and mournful]*
>
> "My dear friends... I'm afraid I bring the most dreadful news. I have been... murdered. Struck down in my own study with a decorative letter opener from my desk."
>
> *[Pause for shocked reactions]*
>
> "My earthly form lies cold in my private study, a brandy glass overturned, spilling across my business papers. There are signs of a brief struggle - my killer did not expect such resistance. The door was locked from inside - the key found in my vest pocket."
>
> "The constable cannot reach us tonight due to the storm, and the roads are treacherous. Until morning, I'm afraid you are all... confined to this house with my murderer. My study has been secured, but I must ask from beyond - did any of you see who visited me after the announcement this evening?"
>
> "I shall remain among you as a spirit observer, watching as justice unfolds. Find my killer, dear friends... find them before dawn breaks."

### Immediate Reactions & Staging Notes

**For the Host:**

- **Guide initial reactions** - Encourage gasps, questions, nervous laughter
- **Control the revelation** - Don't let guests immediately jump into accusations

**Character Reaction Guidelines:**
- **Innocent characters** should show genuine shock and concern
- **Guilty party** should react with appropriate surprise but not overact
- **Characters with motives** might display nervous guilt even if innocent
- **Close relationships** should show more emotional responses


### Transitioning to Investigation

After initial shock subsides:

> [*Donavan speaks*] "While we await the authorities, perhaps we should gather what we know. For all our safety, we must determine if the perpetrator is among us."

**Hand out Clue Pack #1** to each character (see Clue Packs section).

Serve the first course while allowing hushed conversations and nervous speculation. Encourage guests to:

- Share their alibis quietly
- Whisper suspicions
- Form temporary alliances
- Begin revealing their hidden motives through worried confessions

**Host's Role:** Subtly guide conversations if energy drops, but don't solve the mystery for them. Ask leading questions: "Did anyone else notice how quickly Railroad Baron excused himself after dinner?" or "Farmer's Daughter, you seemed quite upset by the business announcement..."

## Act III: Investigation and Debate

- **Duration**: 50min

### Scene setting

The investigation should feel organic while maintaining structure. Guide guests through three distinct phases:

### Round 1 – Alibis and Initial Theories (15min)

> "[Any character can deliver this] Given our situation, I believe we must conduct our own investigation. Perhaps if we each share our whereabouts during the time in question, we can begin to understand what happened to Heinrich. Each character should explain their movements after the announcement this evening."

**Process:**
- Host should note contradictions without immediately pointing them out
- Encourage nervous explanations and defensive reactions

**Key Alibis to Track:**

- **Bennett (guilty):** "I stepped out for fresh air on the terrace - needed to think about the evening's discussions"
- **Donovan:** "I was in the library, reviewing some papers I brought"
- **Lottie Roth:** "I was in the garden, getting some fresh air after the announcement"
- Others should have plausible but not ironclad alibis

**Host's Role:** Ask follow-up questions: "Farmer's Daughter, did you see anyone else when you were in the garden?" "Railroad Baron, how long were you outside? Anyone see you return?"

### Round 2 – Physical Evidence and New Clues (20min)

**Hand out Clue Pack #2** with more specific evidence.

> "Upon closer inspection of the study, we've found several items of interest. The constable's deputy arrived briefly but had to leave due to a bridge washout. He did share these observations..."

**Evidence to Reveal:**
- Muddy footprints leading from the terrace door to the study
- A torn piece of fabric caught on the study window latch
- Heinrich's appointment book showing "Bennett - private meeting - 8:30"
- A partially burned letter in the fireplace (related to railroad debts)
- Signs that someone searched through desk papers before the murder

**Character Reactions:**
- Let guilty parties show subtle nervousness
- Innocent characters should actively theorize
- Allow red herrings to develop naturally

### Round 3 – Open Accusations and Defense (15min)

> "The evidence seems to point in various directions. Perhaps it's time we speak more directly about what we each know - and what we suspect."

**Encourage:**
- Direct accusations based on evidence
- Defensive responses that reveal character motives
- Alliance forming and backstabbing
- Heated exchanges that stay in character

**Host's Management:**
- Keep discussions civil but intense
- Redirect if conversations stagnate
- Ask probing questions: "Railroad Baron, that's quite a strong reaction. Why does this accusation trouble you so?"
- Plant seeds of doubt: "Interesting that three different people claim to have been alone..."

**Red Herring Management:**
- Multiple characters should appear guilty at different points
- Evidence should implicate 2-3 suspects strongly
- Save the most damning evidence against Bennett for the final reveal

## Act IV: The Reveal

- **Duration**: 20min

### Building to the Confession

**Final Evidence Presentation:**

> "I'm afraid there's one final piece of evidence that has come to light. When examining Heinrich's study more closely, we found this telegram hidden beneath other papers on his desk..."

**The Damning Evidence:**
A telegram reading: *"RAILROAD BONDS WORTHLESS STOP INVESTORS DEMANDING IMMEDIATE REPAYMENT STOP BENNETT LIABLE FOR FULL AMOUNT STOP FEDERAL INVESTIGATION PENDING"*

### Bennett's Confession

> *[Bennett, defeated]* "Yes... yes, it's true. I killed Heinrich Roeder, but you must understand - he was going to destroy me! Those railroad bonds he convinced me to purchase were worthless paper. He knew it, and yet he demanded I invest everything I had saved for my family's future. When the announcement was made tonight about upcoming changes in business arrangements, I knew what it meant - I would never see a penny of my money again. Worse, Heinrich was planning to use my ruin to consolidate more power for the Roeder family enterprises."
>
> "I didn't plan to kill him. I went to his study to demand the truth about those bonds. When I confronted him with what I'd learned, he laughed. He said that business was about knowing when to cut losses - and that I was simply a loss he was cutting. He actually offered to let me 'work off' my debts by essentially becoming an indentured servant to the Roeder family enterprises. When I refused and threatened to expose him... he said no one would believe a bankrupt railroad man over Heinrich Roeder. That's when I... I grabbed the letter opener - it happened so quickly."

### Character Epilogues

> "And so ends this tragic evening. While we await the proper authorities, let us reflect on how greed and deception can poison even the most civilized of gatherings."
>
> - **Railroad Baron:** Will face trial for murder, but the questionable business practices may be taken into account
> - **The Banker:** Recovers his loans through the Roeder estate, continues banking
> - **Lottie Roth:** As a Roeder family member, inherits part of the family enterprises and becomes a successful businesswoman
> - **Other characters:** Brief, satisfying conclusions based on their revealed motives
>
> "To truth revealed, and to the hope that justice, however delayed, eventually finds us all."

*End scene with guests breaking character for final discussion and appreciation of the game.*
