Nelson Bennett was a Canadian-born railroad builder and businessman who played a central role in developing Fairhaven in the late 1800s. He was instrumental in bringing the Great Northern Railway to town, fueling hopes that Fairhaven would become the region's great port. Though those dreams faded, Bennett remained a symbol of ambition and hard-nosed competition — especially against rivals like the Larrabees.

### Character card

* **How You See Yourself:** A self-made railroad tycoon, builder of empires, and co-developer of Fairhaven with Larrabee — no one knows railroads like you. Without you, Fairhaven would never have mattered.
* **Personality Traits:** Ambitious, forward-looking, blunt, competitive, and proud. You hate losing face.
* **Motives/Secrets:** You feel Larrabee cheated you in past deals and cut you out of new opportunities. You've sworn to get even, one way or another.
* **Roleplaying Tips:** Be confident, a little arrogant. Interrupt others. Drop hints about betrayals in business. Defend yourself fiercely if accused.

### Introduction

> "My name is Nelson Bennett — I've laid more track than any man west of the Mississippi, and I brought the Great Northern Railroad here to Fairhaven. Some say I have rivals at this table, but business is never for the faint of heart."

### Hidden Motive

* His partnership with Larrabee soured years ago; he still feels cheated.
* He's been excluded from Larrabee's latest investment scheme, which threatens to undermine his own ventures.
* Holds grudges easily and isn't above sabotage.
