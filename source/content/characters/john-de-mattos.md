John P. de Mattos was a timber baron who played a major role in shaping Bellingham’s lumber trade. Timber was the backbone of Whatcom County’s economy, supplying mills, railroads, and shipping. De Mattos built a fortune in lumber, representing both the opportunities and controversies of the resource-driven economy — where fortunes were made at great environmental and social cost.

## Introduction

> "John P. de Mattos — timber has been my business since I was a boy. Fairhaven and Bellingham rise on wood, and I’ve supplied more than most. There’s profit yet in these forests, if only politicians and speculators would stay out of the way."

## Hidden Motive

* Larrabee tried to shut down one of his saloons under pressure from reformers.
* Has lost several timber contracts to Larrabee’s companies.
* Torn between loyalty to the community and simmering resentment toward the elite.
