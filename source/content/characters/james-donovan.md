James J. Donovan was a lawyer, politician, and developer who rose to prominence during the push to unify Whatcom County's four competing towns — Fairhaven, Whatcom, Sehome, and Bellingham — into a single city. As mayor of Fairhaven and later a Washington State senator, he was a key player in the political maneuvering of the time. His blend of law, politics, and real estate made him one of the county's most influential power brokers.

### Character card

* **How You See Yourself:** A respected banker, real estate investor and shrewd negotiator who knows how to pull strings in both law and politics. You think of yourself as the real "kingmaker" in Whatcom County.
* **Personality Traits:** Charming, smooth-talking and outwardly trustworthy, calculating, slippery. You always keep your options open. Known as a man of connections and money.
* **Motives/Secrets:** You've been caught in shady land deals before, and Larrabee has leverage over you. You're terrified he might expose your dealings.
* **Roleplaying Tips:** Play smooth and diplomatic, but let moments of defensiveness slip when pressed. Try to redirect blame to rivals.

### Introduction

> "James J. Donovan, at your service. As a lawyer and developer, I've been fortunate to help guide Bellingham's path toward incorporation and prosperity. I keep one foot in politics and the other in business — some say that's dangerous footing, but it has served me well."

### Hidden Motive

* Larrabee owes his bank a significant loan and has been missing payments.
* If Larrabee defaults, Donovan's reputation — and fortune — could crumble.
* He has quietly invested in Bennett's projects, creating divided loyalties.
