- **Duration**: about 2.5–3 hours
- **Setting**: Food courses with clue rounds naturally built in.
- **Set**: Roeder House (The Larrabee residence)

## Arrival and Introductions

### Arrival

- **Duration**: 15min

As guests arrive:

- Serve drinks and small appetizers
- Guests arrive at the Larrabee home for a formal dinner.
  - Encourage light conversation in character — mingle, establish relationships, and subtle tension. 
  - Non-prying small talk until all guests arrive
- Answer any gameplay questions

### Introductions

- **Duration**: 15min

Once all guests have arrived:

- Grab attention
- Give role cards with their hidden motive(s)
  -  Guests don't reveal their secret motives yet.
- Each guest gives a short introduction of themselves

## ACT I: First Course and Announcement

- **Duration**: 20min

During appetizers/soup C.X. Larrabee makes a dramatic announcement about his **new venture** (railroad expansion, cannery buyouts, copper scheme — you pick).

> "You are all gathered at my home… we shall enjoy a fine dinner and discuss the exciting news I have tonight. [material needed]"

At this point, you slip short secret notes/cards (see clue packs) to each character — little rumors or discoveries they can use later 

(example: Donovan gets a card saying *“You overheard Larrabee telling Bennett he will never see his money back.”*).

Allow guests to mingle and gossip, dropping hints about motives. Encourage subtle in-character accusations or jealous remarks. This news threatens at least 2–3 characters directly. Arguments or icy exchanges may follow. Encourage guests to start gossiping and hinting at grudges (“I hear Mr. Donovan has lent quite a sum to our host…”).

## Act II: The Murder

- **Duration**: 15min

Lights flicker, a commotion is staged, and it’s announced that **C.X. Larrabee has been found dead in his study** (the player playing him now becomes an observer/ghost).

> It was a poisoned drink (classic, easy to stage) or stabbed with a decorative dagger/fire poker (gives you prop fun). [material needed]

Serve first course.

Hand out Clue 2 to all characters: direct but still ambiguous evidence (fragments of notes, witness reports, suspicious behavior).

Shock, then suspicion. Each player now leans into their hidden motives. Guests react in character: check alibis, ask questions, whisper suspicions. Host subtly guides conversations if things stall.

## Act III: Investigation and Debate

- **Duration**: 50min

### Scene setting

1. **Round 1 – Alibis:** Each character explains where they were when the murder occurred. Conflicts and contradictions emerge.
2. **Round 2 – Clues Revealed:** Each guest gets a new note/clue. These can incriminate or exonerate others.

   * Example: Lottie Roth gets a clue card: *“You saw Bennett sneaking toward the study before dinner.”*
   * Example: Crane gets: *“In Larrabee’s pocket diary, you find a note: ‘Donovan will not forgive me if the bank forecloses…’”*

 3. **Round 3 – Open Debate:** Guests accuse, defend, and bargain with each other.

## Act IV: The Reveal

The murderer confesses (voluntarily or after being cornered). [material needed]

Wrap with a brief epilogue of what becomes of each character. [material needed]
