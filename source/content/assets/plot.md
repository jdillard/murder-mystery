## ACT I: First Course and Announcement

- **Duration**: 20min

During appetizers/soup C.X. Larrabee makes a dramatic announcement about his **new venture** (railroad expansion, cannery buyouts, copper scheme — you pick).

> "My dear friends, you are all gathered at my home tonight not merely for the pleasure of your company — though that is considerable — but because each of you has played a role in shaping Whatcom County's destiny. As we dine, I wish to share with you the most ambitious undertaking of my career: a grand consolidation of our region's timber, mining, and railroad interests under a single enterprise — **The Bellingham Bay Development Corporation**.
>
> This venture will require the acquisition of several key properties and partnerships. Nelson, your railroad expertise will be invaluable, though I'm afraid our previous arrangements will need... restructuring. James, your banking connections are essential, and I trust we can resolve certain outstanding obligations through this new partnership. Miss Roth, your family's timber holdings are precisely what we need to complete our vision — I'm confident we can reach terms that serve everyone's interests.
>
> Some of you may find these changes... challenging. But progress demands sacrifice from all of us. Those who embrace this new direction will prosper beyond their wildest dreams. Those who resist..."
>
> *[Larrabee raises his glass with a knowing smile]*
>
> "Well, let us simply say that Whatcom County has no room for those who cannot see the future clearly. To the Bellingham Bay Development Corporation — and to those wise enough to join me!"

At this point, you slip short secret notes/cards (see clue packs) to each character — little rumors or discoveries they can use later 

(example: Donovan gets a card saying *“You overheard Larrabee telling Bennett he will never see his money back.”*).

Allow guests to mingle and gossip, dropping hints about motives. Encourage subtle in-character accusations or jealous remarks. This news threatens at least 2–3 characters directly. Arguments or icy exchanges may follow. Encourage guests to start gossiping and hinting at grudges (“I hear Mr. Donovan has lent quite a sum to our host…”).

## Act II: The Murder

- **Duration**: 15min

Lights flicker, a commotion is staged, and it’s announced that **C.X. Larrabee has been found dead in his study** (the player playing him now becomes an observer/ghost).

> It was a poisoned drink (classic, easy to stage) or stabbed with a decorative dagger/fire poker (gives you prop fun). [material needed]

Serve first course.

Hand out Clue 2 to all characters: direct but still ambiguous evidence (fragments of notes, witness reports, suspicious behavior).

Shock, then suspicion. Each player now leans into their hidden motives. Guests react in character: check alibis, ask questions, whisper suspicions. Host subtly guides conversations if things stall.

## Act III: Investigation and Debate

- **Duration**: 50min

### Scene setting

1. **Round 1 – Alibis:** Each character explains where they were when the murder occurred. Conflicts and contradictions emerge.
2. **Round 2 – Clues Revealed:** Each guest gets a new note/clue. These can incriminate or exonerate others.

   * Example: Lottie Roth gets a clue card: *“You saw Bennett sneaking toward the study before dinner.”*
   * Example: Crane gets: *“In Larrabee’s pocket diary, you find a note: ‘Donovan will not forgive me if the bank forecloses…’”*

 3. **Round 3 – Open Debate:** Guests accuse, defend, and bargain with each other.

## Act IV: The Reveal

The murderer confesses (voluntarily or after being cornered). [material needed]

Wrap with a brief epilogue of what becomes of each character. [material needed]
