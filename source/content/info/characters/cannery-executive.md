A pragmatic industrial executive who built a maritime empire through the salmon canning trade. This character believes in feeding the world through efficient resource extraction, balancing pride in their industry with anxiety about competitors threatening their dominance.

## Historical Inspiration

Everett B. Deming helped lead Pacific American Fisheries (PAF), which grew into the world's largest salmon canning operation, headquartered in Fairhaven. PAF's massive network of canneries, ships, and workers transformed Bellingham into a hub of the global salmon trade. Deming epitomized the industrial might — and cutthroat practices — of the canning industry in the early 20th century.
