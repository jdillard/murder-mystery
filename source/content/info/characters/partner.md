The devoted partner of a powerful industrialist, this character balances public grace with private concerns. They are deeply invested in community welfare, charitable causes, and cultural development, often serving as the conscience when business ambitions go too far. Behind their dignified exterior lies someone who knows where the bodies are buried.

## Historical Inspiration

Frances Payne Larrabee, wife of C.X., was one of the city's most respected social leaders. Beyond her role as hostess, she advocated for education, the arts, and public parks. After her husband's death, she carried forward his legacy, ensuring the donation of 20 acres of land that became the core of Larrabee State Park. She represents the quieter but deeply influential civic contributions of women in the region's history.
