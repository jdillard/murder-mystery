A rough-and-tumble lumber industry mogul who built their fortune from the ground up through hard work and shrewd business. This character represents the working-class backbone of the economy, unafraid to speak bluntly and fight for their interests against more refined competitors.

## Historical Inspiration

John P. de Mattos was a timber baron who played a major role in shaping Bellingham's lumber trade. Timber was the backbone of Whatcom County's economy, supplying mills, railroads, and shipping. De Mattos built a fortune in lumber, representing both the opportunities and controversies of the resource-driven economy â€” where fortunes were made at great environmental and social cost.
