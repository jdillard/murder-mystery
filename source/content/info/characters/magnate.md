A commanding industrial titan who built their fortune through copper mines, real estate speculation, and civic investments. This character projects confidence and vision while harboring dangerous financial secrets that could destroy everything they've built.

## Historical Inspiration

Charles Xavier Larrabee was a copper magnate and philanthropist who moved to Fairhaven in 1890. With his brother Samuel, he invested heavily in mines, real estate, and civic projects, leaving a lasting mark on Bellingham. He and his wife Frances donated land that became Larrabee State Park â€” Washington's first state park. Known as both generous and ambitious, Larrabee embodied the boomtown energy of early 20th-century Whatcom County.
