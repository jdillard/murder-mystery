A powerful railroad magnate who built an empire through steel rails and ruthless ambition. This character embodies the aggressive entrepreneurial spirit that shaped the American West, wielding influence through transportation networks and business deals. Known for cutthroat competition and an unforgiving memory for perceived betrayals.

## Historical Inspiration

Nelson Bennett was a Canadian-born railroad builder and businessman who played a central role in developing Fairhaven in the late 1800s. He was instrumental in bringing the Great Northern Railway to town, fueling hopes that Fairhaven would become the region's great port. Though those dreams faded, Bennett remained a symbol of ambition and hard-nosed competition — especially against rivals like the Larrabees.

## Character Introduction

"I am the Railroad Baron — I've laid more track than anyone west of the Mississippi, and I brought the Great Northern Railroad here to Fairhaven. Some say I have rivals at this table, but business is never for the faint of heart."

## How You See Yourself

A self-made railroad tycoon, builder of empires, and co-developer of Fairhaven with the Magnate — no one knows railroads like you. Without you, Fairhaven would never have mattered.

## Personality Traits

Ambitious, forward-looking, blunt, competitive, and proud. You hate losing face.

## Motives & Secrets

You feel the Magnate cheated you in past deals and cut you out of new opportunities. You've sworn to get even, one way or another.
