    mm:introduction "The Banker, at your service. As a lawyer and developer, I've been fortunate to help guide Bellingham's path toward incorporation and prosperity. I keep one foot in politics and the other in business — some say that's dangerous footing, but it has served me well." ;
    mm:personalityTrait "Charming, smooth-talking and outwardly trustworthy, calculating, slippery. You always keep your options open. Known as a man of connections and money." ;
    mm:roleplayingTip "Play smooth and diplomatic, but let moments of defensiveness slip when pressed. Try to redirect blame to rivals." ;
